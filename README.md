# UNC-CH BeAM Laser Cutter Queue

### Technology

#### Front-End
Vue.js, vue-router, and Okta Vue SDK

#### Back-End
Node.js with Express, Okta JWT Verifier, Sequelize, and Finale.
I have also included an offloading secure authentication to Okta's OpenID Connect API that locks down protected routes and performs CRUD operations through a backend REST API server.
